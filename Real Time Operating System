A general definition of embedded systems is: embedded systems are computing systems with tightly coupled
hardware and software integration, that are designed to perform a dedicated function.The word embedded reflects
the fact that these systems are usually an integral part of a larger system, known as the embedding system. Multiple
embedded systems can coexist in an embedding system.they are systems within systems.They either cannot or do not function on their own.

In some cases, embedded systems can function as standalone systems. The network router.

The processors found in common personal computers (PC) are general-purpose or universal processors.
They are designed to be suitable for a variety of applications.These
embedded processors are special-purpose processors designed for a specific class of applications.

The key is
application awareness, i.e., knowing the nature of the applications and meeting the requirement for those applications
that it is designed to run.

some embedded
processors are limited in functionality, i.e., a processor is good enough for the class of applications for which it was
designed but is likely inadequate for other classes of applications. This is one reason why many embedded
processors do not have fast CPU speeds. For example, the processor chosen for a personal digital assistant (PDA)
device does not have a floating-point co-processor because floating-point operations are either not needed or
software emulation is sufficient.
